# org-utils - go mobile with Org mode

![time to go mobile](http://i.giphy.com/10yeg1mIqKZ1Kw.gif)

This project contains utilities for getting Org mode agenda items into iCloud
reminders. Run it with [Pythonista](http://omz-software.com/pythonista/).

**Stay tuned...**


## Testing
We use `unittest` so tests work without additional dependencies.
Run *test.py* to get the same output in Pythonista as the regular shell command
`python -m unittest discover`.
